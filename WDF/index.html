        <h3>About this website</h3>
        <p>This is an unofficial website of the game dynamite by
            <i>Softwire</i>.</p>
        <p> The aim of this site is to offer much more functions than the official website could, as the developers of the official
            website are full-time employees hence have a lot of others things to deal with.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ELO Rating" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>ELO Rating</h3>
        <p>This is an unofficial ELO rating (there is no official version currently) of bots on the official website. Only matches
            that finished normally (by score) are taken into account.</p>
        <p>For the parameters used,
            <a href="elo_spec.html">click here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>ELO Rating (20180708)</h3>
        <div style="overflow-y:auto;overflow-x:auto;" id="ELOTable">

        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="Tournament" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Better Tournament</h3>
        <p>The tournament on the original website is very unreliable and inconvenient to use -- for example, there is no way
            to stop a running tournament; bots are likely to throw errors due to inconsistent time limit and memory limit;
            format of the tournament is limited (currently only a full round-robin tournament is possible).</p>
        <p>This feature is under development.</p>
