<h1 class="major">Puzzle: UFO</h1>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>You thought that this might be another preposterous puzzle that wastes you an hour of studying time. <i>No.</i> The tripos exam is impending and some friendly aliens have decided to aid you in your preparation efforts. However, as soon as they reached the earth, they lost their way among the tremendous crowd of homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Luckily, you had an acute probe to detect the aliens, or more precisely, the UFOs drove by them. However, in fear of losing any wandering alien friends, you raised the level of sensitivity of your probe so that it detects anything that resembles a UFO and decided to manually filter the results later on. You pressed the button and the outlandish probe in your hand started peeking eagerly. You put it on the table and opted to read some notes instead of barely waiting for the results.</p>
<p>When you return, the room was flushed with cases of 'UFO detected!'. You knew something had went wrong, so rushed to the desk and... <i>Oops.</i> The sensitivity of your probe was set too high, so that it reported detecting UFOs when some of what it actually had found were UFDs! You wondered a while what UFDs might be, and then suddenly recalled some words from Dr. Randal-Williams, 'An integral domain is a Unique Factorization Domain if every non-unit element may be written as product of irreducible elements in a unique way up to rearrangements and associates...'</p>
<p>Now it's your time to seize those creepy UFDs and throw them away. Then you could have the aliens to help you study for the exams! Or they probably <i>have</i> done so.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>In each of the following 10 cases of 'UFO detected!', determine whether it is a UFD instead. It is guaranteed that a UFO is not a UFD. <br>You score +5 for each correctly repeled UFD and +15 for each correctly detected UFO. For each UFD that you thought was a UFO you score -15 due to waste of resources to rescue a UFD instead of a UFO, and for each UFO that you thought was a UFD you score -30 due to homicides of your alien friends. If you are unsure, you can choose 'Not Sure' and elicit help from your alien friends and that doesn't contribute to your score.</p>
