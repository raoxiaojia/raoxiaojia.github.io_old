\section{Introduction}

$www.staslab.cam.ac.uk/~mike/AFM/$ for course material. However lecture notes only come after lectures, so taking notes is still necessary..

Assumptions for this course:\\
No dividends, zero tick size (continuous), no transaction costs, no short-selling constraints, infinitely divisible assets, no bid-ask spread, infinite market depth, agents have preferences for expected utility.

\section{Discrete time models}

We'll assume there are $n$ assets with price $P_t^i$ at time $t$ for asset $i$. Apparently $P_t^i$ is a random variable on some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\P)$.

We'll use the notation $P=(P_t^1,...,P_t^n)_{t \geq 0}$ which is a $n$-dimensional stochastic process.

Information available at time $t$ is modelled by a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_t \subseteq \mathcal{F}$.

The assumption will be $\mathcal{F}_s \subseteq \mathcal{F}_t$ for $s \leq t$ (in other words, $\mathcal{F}$ is a filtration):

\begin{defi} (Filtration)\\
A \emph{Filtration} is a collection of $\sigma$-algebra $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ such that $\mathcal{F}_s \subseteq \mathcal{F}_t$ for $s \leq t$.
\end{defi}

We'll assume that $\mathcal{F}_0$ is trivial, i.e. if $A$ is $\mathcal{F}_0$ measure then $\mathbb{P} = 0$ or $1$. As a result $P_0^1,...,P_0^n$ are constants.

We assume that $(P_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is adapted to the filtration, i.e. $P_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \geq 0$. Usually we assume the filtration is generated by $P$ itself (so all the information is in the price).

Let $c_t$ be the amount consumed at time $t$ which will be a $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable scalar, $H_t = (H_t^1,...,H_t^n)$ be the vector of portfolio weights, so $H_t^i$ is the number of shares held at $(t-1,t]$ (remember we are in discrete time), which will be $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$-measurable. $(c_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is adapted ($\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable), $(H_t)_{t \geq 1}$ is predictable/previsible ($\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$-measurable, $n$-dimensional. 

\begin{defi}
The process $(c,H)$ is self-financing if $H_t\cdot P_t = c_t+H_{t+1} \cdot P_t$ for all $t \geq 1$.
\end{defi}

For example, $X_0$ be the initial wealth, $X_0-c_0$ is the post-consumption wealth ($=H_1 \cdot P_0$), $X_1=H_1 \cdot P_1$ is the pre-consumption wealth at time 1, $X_1-c_1$ is the post consumption wealth (which is $H_2\cdot P_1$. In other words, at any specific time, consumption takes place and then price updates.

Background assumption on behaviour of an agent:\\
Say $c^2$ is preffered to $c^1$ iff $\E U(c_0^1,c_1^1,...) < \E U(c_0^2,c_1^2,...)$ where $U$ is some investor utility function, which is increasing in all $c_i$, concave (so risk-avert)

\begin{defi}
An arbitrage is a self-financing investment consumption strategy $(c,H)$ such that there exists a non-random time $T>0$ s.t. $c_0 = -H_1 \cdot P_0$, $c_t = (H_t - H_{t+1}) \cdot P_t$ for $1 \leq t \leq T-1$, and $c_T =H_T \cdot P_T$ (in words, with initial wealth $X_0 = 0$ and post-consumption wealth at $T$ $X_T-C_T=0$), that $\P(c_t \geq 0)$ for all $0 \leq t \leq T) = 1$, and $\P(c_t > 0$ for some $0 \leq t \leq T) > 0$.
\end{defi}
