\section{Introduction}

Consider the $n\times n$ box (we only consider points of integer coordinate). For every edge we keep them with some probability $p$. We say an edge is open if we choose to keep the edge, and closed otherwise.

Some problems we could consider:

\begin{eg}
Let $f_n(p)$ be the probability that there exists a path from the leftmost edge to the rightmost (i.e. horizontal crossing of the box).\\
Apparently $f_n(0)=0,f_n(1)=1$. More interestingly, $f_n(\frac{1}{2})=\frac{1}{2}$ (by duality, note that if there is no horizontal crossing then there is vertical crossing in a dual construction by having edges through the centres of graphs?).

As $n\to\infty$, $f$ converges to a step function with a critical point at $1/2$, and takes $0$ and $1$ at the sub-critical and super-critical sections respectively.
